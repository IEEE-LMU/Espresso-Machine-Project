## Introduction
### Python
* here are sources to get started on python, we'll explore pyQT (this UI's framework) in the meetings: 
    * [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-learn-python-3-tutorials/)
    * [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21)
### Git
* to keep everything organized in this repo, we will be using branches and Pull Requests (PR) to contribute to the UI.
We will run through the branch structure and PRs in the meeting, but here is a git cheatsheet for now:
